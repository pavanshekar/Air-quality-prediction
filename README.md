# Air-quality-prediction
As air pollution is a complex mixture of toxic components with considerable impact on humans, forecasting air pollution concentration emerges as a priority for improving life quality. So with the help of Python tools and some Machine Learning algorithms, we try to predict the air quality. 

## Install
This project requires Python 3.6 and the following libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Code
Template code is provided in the `Speckbit Project Air_Quality_Prediction(T).ipynb` and `Speckbit Project Air_Quality_Prediction[C6H6(GT)].ipynb` notebook file. You will also be requires to use the included dataset file `AirQualityUCl.csv`.

### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Speckbit Project Air_Quality_Prediction(T).ipynb
ipython notebook Speckbit Project Air_Quality_Prediction[C6H6(GT)].ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Speckbit Project Air_Quality_Prediction(T).ipynb
jupyter notebook Speckbit Project Air_Quality_Prediction[C6H6(GT)].ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Dataset information
The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year)representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer. Evidences of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts are present as described in De Vito et al., Sens. And Act. B, Vol. 129,2,2008 (citation required) eventually affecting sensors concentration estimation capabilities. Missing values are tagged with -200 value. This dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.
